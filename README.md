# Multipurpose-forest-security-system
Forest monitoring has become a key issue in national and international environmental process. This report documents the approach taken by us in enhancing the Forest monitoring system.
# Problem statement
This project aims at eliminating the following issues:
1. Constant smuggling of natural resources like Sandalwood trees for commercial process.
2. Poaching of endangered species, and forest fires.
3. Unable to guide or navigate the lost people in the tropical forest.
# Objectives
1. It should be able to guide/help the lost travellers to navigate through the forest.
2. It should be able to detect the presence of certain animals.
3. It must be able to detect forest fires and communicate with the dept. to take action as soon as possible.
4. It must be able to monitor the sandalwood trees from being chopped.

# Conclusion
The proposed model is able to guide/help the lost travellers to navigate through the forest, able to detect forest fires and communicate with the forest department to take action as soon as possible and it is able to monitor the sandalwood trees from being chopped.

# Future Scope
The proposed multipurpose forest security system has significant potential for future enhancements and expansions. One of the key areas for development is the integration of advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of animal detection and fire prediction. By utilizing real-time data analytics, the system could provide more precise alerts and responses to potential threats, such as poaching or illegal logging activities.
Overall, the future scope of this project lies in leveraging technology to create a more robust and responsive forest monitoring system that not only protects natural resources but also promotes sustainable practices among local communities.
